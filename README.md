# README Generator

## Description

- As a programmer, it is important to have a professional readme that describes how an application works. This local application will allow me to have the essentials for a professional readme by answering a few quick questions. 
- This application will allow programmers to focus on the how's and why's of an application without the gruntwork of README layout issuse. 
- I learned how to grab data from inquirer to render and write a new file, as well as the essentials of a professional and clean README file. 

## Installation

- install node.js
- install inquirer by using "npm i" in the command line
- use node.js to answer the questions, as seen below

## Usage

- Open an integrated termial from index.js
- run node.js with this file
- Answer the questions given about the project
